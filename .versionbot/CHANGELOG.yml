        Disable the systemd watchdog keep-alive in favor of the in-kernel
        mechanism (CONFIG_DW_WATCHDOG)

        The NanoPC-T4 has CONFIG_DW_WATCHDOG as built-in.

        When using systemd to pet the watchdog in addition to the above kernel
        watchdog driver, it has been observed that after a random period of time
        the kernel will complain:

         dw_wdt: keepalive missed, machine will reset

        To work around this we disable the systemd watchdog feature and we rely
        solely on the in-kernel watchdog keepalive mechanism.
