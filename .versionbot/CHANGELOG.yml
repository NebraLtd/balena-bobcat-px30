                Fixes #1564


                This bbclass uses the common layer path advertised by BBLAYERS
                to find

                the paths to different resources in board repository. For
                example

                machine json - to get the slug and advertise it in os-release.
                After

                renaming the common layer (resin to balena) and because we
                support old

                references to the old common layer name (by including a dummy

                deprecation layer), we need to make sure this class can cope now
                with

                both cases.

                Poky, following os-release(5), sanitizes VERSION_ID accordingly
                but in

                doing so it produces a nonisemver compliant version. For
                example:

                    VERSION="2.37.0+rev1"
                    VERSION_ID="2.37.0-rev1"

                This patch reverts that to make sure rev is a build tag.

                This change backports a PR[1] that is already in systemd and
                will come

                included by default from the version in Yocto warrior.


                In summary, with this change we fix newer NM which stopped
                handling

                rp_filter when connected to multiple interfaces. See "device:
                disable

                rp_filter handling" commit from NM. Without this change, only
                the

                default route will me usable and binding to a specific interface
                will

                break connectivity if that interface is not also the default
                route for

                the target IP.

                which

                in turn is a tmpfs location. We want this location persistent so
                we can

                save paired devices over reboot. We do that by adding the
                corresponding

                bind mount to the state partition and setting bluez to depend on
                this

                mount unit.

                VERSION and VERSION_ID had a slightly different semantics in
                balenaOS.

                VERSION was referring to the BalenaOS (host OS) version (which
                is coming from

                device repositories) while VERSION_ID was set to the
                DISTRO_VERSION.

                This brings confusion so we change it to adhere to

                This is done because a feature
                (RESIN_SUPERVISOR_MIXPANEL_REPORT) needs

                more work before releasing in production.

        Disable the systemd watchdog keep-alive in favor of the in-kernel
        mechanism (CONFIG_DW_WATCHDOG)
      hash: 7a978c60566ac77052403ac8c4a8e4e238dc9ca9
      body: |
        The NanoPC-T4 has CONFIG_DW_WATCHDOG as built-in.

        When using systemd to pet the watchdog in addition to the above kernel
        watchdog driver, it has been observed that after a random period of time
        the kernel will complain:

         dw_wdt: keepalive missed, machine will reset

        To work around this we disable the systemd watchdog feature and we rely
        solely on the in-kernel watchdog keepalive mechanism.
